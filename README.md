# Leetcode

Files in this repoitory are the my solution to the problems on the webiste Leetcode.

Problems solved using Python 3 and C++

This starts as a personal challenge. I will try to update and use this repository to keep track of my progress in coding and keep a cloud storage.

I am not claiming any of this code as my own. I don't own anything. I am using it to learn to code and improve my skills at both C++ and Python3.
